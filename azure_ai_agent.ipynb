    "3. **Copy the following values:**\n",
    "   - **Application (client) ID** → `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`\n",
    "   - **Directory (tenant) ID** → `AZURE_TENANT_ID`\n",

    "2. Messages Added     → User and agent exchange messages\n",
    "3. Context Maintained → Agent remembers previous messages\n",

    "- Each thread maintains **conversation history**\n",
    "- Agent can reference **previous messages** in same thread\n",

    "3. **Complex Business Scenarios:**\n",

    "\n",
    "4. **Edge Cases:**\n",
